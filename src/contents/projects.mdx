In the second phase of the course students learn how to make use of online data to study social and cultural phenomena: in a question-driven process, each group design protocols for data collection, analyze data and produce research findings using data visualizations. The outcome of this phase is an interactive research report.

Each report focuses on a specific issue: apps for face and body modifications; the aesthetic of conspiracy theories; the politics of content moderator jobs online; hashtag hijacking and other kinds of digital activism; the relationship between digital platforms and physical places; automation and content farms on Youtube.

In the last phase, students turn part of the research carried out in the previous phase into discursive communication artifacts that expose, show or make known the critical aspects of the subjects researched to a specific audience. To this end, the aim is to design communication artifacts that invite the public to reflect and act on the explored subjects.

Students reflect on the meaning and agency of "the public", how different groups mobilize around various issues and how data can play a central role in the process of forming publics, and they are also encouraged to recognize the political role that their design practices play with technology and how they impact on society.

The result of the phase is an experimental digital artifact that can be used by a specific audience to act on the topic.
